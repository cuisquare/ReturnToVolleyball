# Motivation {-}

This document aims to support LSKVC in their organisation and running of official LSKVC outdoor volleyball sessions returning from the COVID19 hiatus. Its overarching aim is to provide means to reduce the risks of virus propagation, protecting our members and the general population and create the start of a sustainable way to play volleyball during the ongoing pandemic. 

The **Players Rules** section outlines behaviour expected from players during lSKVC outdoor play. 

The  Player Rules are made of:

* Rules and obligations as extracted and adapted for our purposes from the Volleyball England document titled "Procedure and Risk Assessments for Outdoor Volleyball Training and Matches
During COVID- 19 Controls" ([link](https://media.volleyballengland.org/docs/Return%20to%20play%20outdoor%20volleyball%20-%20risk%20assessment.pdf))
* Additional specific rules based on our specific Risk Assessment.

The **Risk Assessment** (available at  *[https://github.com/cuisquare/ReturnToOutdoorVolleyball/blob/master/LSKVC_ParkPlay_RiskAssessment.pdf](https://github.com/cuisquare/ReturnToOutdoorVolleyball/blob/master/LSKVC_ParkPlay_RiskAssessment.pdf)*) must be read and understood alongside those rules. 

The **Club Requirements** (available at  *[https://github.com/cuisquare/ReturnToOutdoorVolleyball/blob/master/LSKVC_ParkPlay_ClubRequirements.pdf](https://github.com/cuisquare/ReturnToOutdoorVolleyball/blob/master/LSKVC_ParkPlay_ClubRequirements.pdf)*) should also be read to be aware of the level of support you can expect during a session.
